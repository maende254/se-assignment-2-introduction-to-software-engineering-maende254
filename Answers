1 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.
Software engineering is a systematic, discipline that uses engineering principles in developing, operating and maintenance of software. Traditional programming differs from the software engineering from the approach as software engineering has a software development cycle while in rational coding was mainly focused on writing a code to solver a specific problem or solver a specific task. In software engineering in involves a team with the use of tolls like git hub while in traditional it was more of an individual task. In software engineering it uses structured methodologies such as waterfall, agile and scrum to manage development processes but in traditional that is not available.
 software development life cycle is the process that is involved in developing a software which you start with Requirement in whereby you are gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements and second part is design, this is creating a software architecture and user interface then followed by implementation, this is where you are writing the code and building the software according to your design. After this you conducting testing to ensure the software meets quality standard and if the software is okay and functions well we do deployment where we release the software to the customer and then lastly is the maintenance of the software, were we provide support, updates and enhancements to the software after development.
 Various development methodologies guide the software development process, including Waterfall adaptability to change, and suitability for different project types and team dynamics second one is Agile which is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change and then there is Scrum: Agile framework emphasizing small, self-organizing teams working in short iterations called sprints.
 The difference between Agile and waterfall is that waterfall is flowing downwards while in Agile there is not structure. In waterfall is adaptability to change and is suitable for different project while in Agile is iterative and incremental approach which focuses on flexibility and collaboration.
 Modularity in software design is the principle of dividing a software system into discrete, self-contained units or modules that can be developed, tested and maintained independently but function cohesively when integrated .When it comes to scalability system can be scaled more easily by adding or modifying modules without extensive changed to the overall architecture.
 Testing in engineering it involves the systematic process of ensuring that software products meets specified quality standards and functional requirements and it involves, unit testing=which is testing of the individual components or modules, integrating testing-which is testing of interaction between different components or subsystems, system testing which is the testing of the entire software system and lastly acceptance testing, which is the testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
 Version control system are software tools that are used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members and it includes Git and subversion.
 Software Project Management is the entails different activities which is carried out and aimed at overseeing and controlling the development, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
 The role of a software manager includes project planning and scheduling, resource management, team leadership ,risk management ,stakeholder communication ,quality Assurance ,change management ,performance tracking and post project evaluation
